# REACT - TVMAZE API - Semantic UI

This is the recreation of the below project in React

https://github.com/adenrulz/TV-Show-Search-App

You can search for tv series and get their poster image through TVMAZE API

http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=test

I used Semantic UI for the styling of the search bar.
